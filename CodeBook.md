CodeBook for tidy-UCIHAR dataset
================================
This dataset is derived from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, located here (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

It contains the calculated mean for the measures from the original dataset
that contain mean or standard deviation values grouped by subject and activity

Dataset column description:
---------------------------
Column 1: <subject> ; an identifier that uniquely identifies the subject
Column 2: <activity> ; the activity that the subject was performing when the base measure was recorded
Column 3: <variable> ; the name of the base measure from the original dataset
Column 4: <value> ; the calculated mean of the base measure grouped by subject and activity

Transformations:
---------------
Six datasets from the original study (reference above) are merged into
one dataset that contains the subject, activity, and their associated sensor
measurements.  All measurements except those dealing with mean and standard
deviation are pruned from the data.  The mean for the remaining measures is
computed by subject, by activity.
